# FlexLayout

Because flex is so common there are a `Row` and a `Column` components, with a lot of utility that mean it is very easy to create complex layouts without having to create extra styles.

- justify: like the `justify-content` flex property.
- gap: like the `gap` property, it accepts any `Size`.
- align: like the `align-items` flex property.
- padding: like the `padding` property, it accepts any `Padding`.
