# Link

The `Link` component looks the same as the `Button` component and the only difference is that the underlying HTML is an anchor tag.

## Link variants

The basic `Link` comes in three main variants, each of them with a specific intent in mind. It also support a "disabled" variant, for cases where the button is not actionable.

- Positive: actions that are going to create something or strongly agree
- Secondary: actions that are less central to the user experience
- Negative: actions that are going to delete data or remove something
- Disabled: actions that are not available

<Row gap="large" align="center" padding="large" justify="center">
  <Link label="Positive" color="positive" href="/" />
  <Link label="Secondary" color="secondary" href="/" />
  <Link label="Negative" color="negative" href="/" />
  <Link label="Disabled" color="positive" disabled href="/" />
</Row>

```js
<Row gap="large" align="center" padding="large" justify="center">
  <Link label="Positive" color="positive" href="/" />
  <Link label="Secondary" color="secondary" href="/" />
  <Link label="Negative" color="negative" href="/" />
  <Link label="Disabled" color="positive" disabled href="/" />
</Row>
```

## Bare link

The bare `Link` variants fulfill the same function than the basic counterparts but have a lighter style that can be more easily integrated in complex components.

<Row gap="large" align="center" padding="large" justify="center">
  <Link bare label="Positive" color="positive" href="/" />
  <Link bare label="Secondary" color="secondary" href="/" />
  <Link bare label="Negative" color="negative" href="/" />
  <Link bare label="Disabled" color="positive" disabled href="/" />
</Row>

```js
<Row gap="large" align="center" padding="large" justify="center">
  <Link bare label="Positive" color="positive" href="/" />
  <Link bare label="Secondary" color="secondary" href="/" />
  <Link bare label="Negative" color="negative" href="/" />
  <Link bare label="Disabled" color="positive" disabled href="/" />
</Row>
```
