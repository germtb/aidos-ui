# jss

Aidos UI has a mechanism to do css in js, which, for lack of a better name, is called `jss`, which is the name of the only function that is needed. The idea is similar to other css in js frameworks: colocation is nice, adding javascrip features to CSS solves many of the problems CSS has.

## How it works

The way the library works looks similar to inline styles:

```js
<div className={jss({ background: "red", padding: 12 })} />
```

Internally what is happening is that each property gets atomized into a single CSS classname with a unique hash that gets re-used.

```HTML

<style>
.x1uc1pme {
  background: red;
}

.x1kbdebd {
  padding: 12;
}
</style>
<div class="x1uc1pme x1kbdebd" />
```

The CSS class name is a hash based on each key-pair. This makes it deterministic, which enables for this system to work with server rendered hydrated react.

## Selectors

Because of how this system works not all selectors can be written, but this is a good thing because arguably CSS selectors are so powerful that it is very easy to make something too hard to understand
