# useCookie

`useCookie` is a hook that can be used to get acceess to cookies by name, and use them as if they were React component state.

```js
const [darkModeEnabled, setDarkModeEnabled] = useCookie("dark-mode", {
  initialValue: false,
  // loadingValue could be different to initial value for example if we are server rendering,
  // in which case we do not have access to cookies and you may decide to assign another
  // value, like "pending".
  loadingValue: false,
});
```
